# Requirements
## Introduction :
* Mathematical operations play a major role in our daily lives. In our daily life, we will be involving with different types of calculations. All things around us is filled with different types of shapes and dimensions .so we need to calculate the dimensions of the things for the daily required activities such as area, perimeter, surface area of different objects
## Objective :
* The main objective of this project is to solve basic and advanced mathematical problems. The operations to be performed are area of square ,area of rectangle, Perimeter of rectangle, frustum of cone, volume of hallow cylinder, area of rhombus area of triangle  area of equilateral triangle, and volume of sphere etc.
## Features :
*  Area of square: The  square() function takes one operands as input and it results in a*a.
*  Area of Rectangle: The  a_rectangle() function takes two operands as input and it results in a*b.
*  Perimeter of Rectangle: The perimeter of rectangle P_rectangle() function takes two operands as input and it results in 2*(a+b).
*  Area of circle: The Area of circle a_circle() function takes one operand as input and it results in 3.14*a*a
*  Circumference of circle: The circumference of circle c_circle() function takes one operands as input and it results in 2*3.14*a.
*  Volume of sphere: The volume of sphere v_sphere() function takes one operand as input and it results in (4/3)*3.14*a*a*a.
*  Surface area of sphere: The surface area of sphere sa__sphere() function takes one operand as input and it results in (4/3)*3.14*a*a
*  Area of triangle: The Area of triangle triangle() function takes two operand as input and it results in 0.5*a*b
*  Area of equilateral triangle: The Area of  equilateral triangle e_triangle() function takes one operand as input and it results in sqrt(3/4)*a*a
*  Area of Rhombus: The Area of Rhombus rhombus() function takes two operand as input and it results in 0.5*a*b.
*  frustum of cone: The frustum of cone frustum_of_cone() function takes three operand as input and it results in (((3.14*a)/3)*(((b*b*b)-(c*c*c))/c))
* Volume of hallow cylinder : The Volume of Hallow  cylinder hallow_cylinder() function takes three operand as input and results in (3.14*a*((b*b*b)-(c*c*c))).
